           IN LATE 2011, Alli Bautista, an artist, was preparing to paint in her bedroom in San Diego. The apartment was spacious yet cozy with warm wooden floors. Bautista’s easel stood in front of large windows accented by crown molding. While she painted, she always listened to music mixes. On this particular day, she had selected a mix on her laptop called Show #49 (Soulection Radio). A remix by the U.K. producer Synkro of a song by Submotion Orchestra called “Always” began to play through her headphones and the smooth groove and soulful electronic sounds instantly captured her attention.

            About five minutes into the first public show, broadcast on college radio station KBeach, there was voice belonging to host Joe Kay: “Next level sounds,” he said. “This is the sound of the future. This is the sound of tomorrow. We are just getting warmed up. We are infinite — so much more to go.”

            Four years and 200 shows later, Soulection Radio is now broadcast on Apple Music’s Beats 1 Radio to millions of people in over 100 countries around the world. Soulection Radio is one of the only curated shows on Beats 1 not overseen by an already-established recording artist or longtime radio personality. A short list of some of the other shows includes programs from Dr. Dre, Pharrell, Q-Tip, Elton John, Drake, Disclosure, Ebro Darden of New York’s Hot 97 and Zane Lowe, Apple’s current radio chief and former BBC Radio 1 presenter.

            Advising at The New School is super impersonal and the advisors don't know you outside of what a computer tells them, which is basically the opposite of what the classes are like.
